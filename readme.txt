Transform your standard galleries into an immersive full-screen experience without requiring you to connect to WordPress.com

== Description ==

I love this Carousel feature that is part of JetPack however I didn't like that I was being forced to connect my site with WordPress.com to use a feature that has no connection with WordPress.com. Well, I simply forked the Carousel module from JetPack. I am releasing it for all those who want to use this feature with freedom of choice.

The carousel feature transform your standard galleries into an immersive full-screen experience with comments and EXIF metadata.
